The main goal of this course is to introduce principles and best practices of software engineering, and to develop a team software system using enterprise class frameworks. To consolidate this goal, students will assume various roles inherent in a development team and build a system throughout the semester using a reference architecture / platform (eg String Boot, Django, .NET).
